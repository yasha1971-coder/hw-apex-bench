# ACEAPEX 2.2.0 — the genome encoder gets fast, the GPU path loses zstd

Format ACEPX2 is unchanged. Default-profile archives written by 2.2.0 decode with 2.1.0; the
zstd-free profiles (rANS tokens, open) need 2.2.0.

## What changed

- **l1 encoder, default for DNA** ([ADR-020](../docs/DECISIONS.md)). A small head table without a
  chain, matches of at least 32 bytes, fast skipping over literal runs; short repeats are left to the
  literal coder, which handles them better. On chr1: **59 429 097 B instead of 68 127 499 (-12.8 %)**,
  and encoding goes from 65 to **444 MB/s per thread**. Text keeps the previous matcher (`AX_ENC=l1` or
  level 3 selects l1 anywhere).
- **A genome archive without zstd** (ADR-018, ADR-019). `AX_PROFILE=open` writes rANS token chunks and
  an open DNA pack for the literals. Every decoder reads it (C++, C99, Python, GPU); the GPU tool
  decodes it without a single nvCOMP call.
- **GPU tool**: `--pipeline=auto` overlaps the host-to-device copy with the decode when it pays off.
- **fixed: concurrent API calls could return wrong output; affected 2.1.0.** Several threads calling
  the library at once (lzbench `-T`, a server) shared per-call state; under two threads over
  lzbench's source tree 2.1.0 returned wrong bytes for 22 of 4569 files. The copy in lzbench 2.4
  ("1.0.1") is not affected (0 in the same test). Single-threaded use was never affected.
- **Portability**: the library builds with MinGW; checked on x86-64, x86-32, ARM32, ARM64 and
  PPC64LE (the last three under qemu): conformance set, byte-identical encoder output, API tests.
- **Closed by measurement, not shipped**: two-pass CPU decode, match-source prefetch, a fused GPU
  seq+bases kernel, dense (order-1) literals as a format mode. Numbers are in the CHANGELOG.

## GPU numbers

RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition (Colab, commit 27b61b1), 16 KiB blocks, 64 KiB literal chunks,
median of 3, every row bit-perfect (FNV of the GPU output equals the original), libzstd 1.5.5.

| corpus | profile | archive bytes | on-device | GB/s | with H2D |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| chr1 (254 MB) | zstd | 60 442 704 | 3.50 ms | 72.5 | 4.55 ms |
| chr1 | open (no zstd) | 63 083 287 | 2.83 ms | 89.9 | 3.92 ms |
| T2T CHM13 (3.16 GB) | zstd | 822 393 156 | 35.54 ms | 88.8 | 49.76 ms |
| T2T | open (no zstd) | 853 264 869 | 27.14 ms | 116.3 | 31.06 ms (pipelined, 101.6 GB/s) |

Honest caveat: the open profile is **4.4 % (chr1) / 3.8 % (T2T) larger** than the zstd profile with
the same encoder. That is the price of dropping zstd; it buys a decode path that is fully open and
faster on the device.
